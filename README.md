# Design Patterns in Go

## Description
This is my personal translation from the classic `Gang of Four` Design Patterns into Go. Examples are based on the book [Dive into Design Patterns][book] by Alexander Shvets.

The patterns are categorized by their intention group:
- Creational
- Structural
- Behavioral
